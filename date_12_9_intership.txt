  Today morning i try to push the daily_article to my github at that time i read how to push the file in the github and then excute it. I facing an error so i keep trying 2 to 3 time and then my friend praveen arrived i ask the about the error. he analyse the error change the file name. because i proved a gap on the filename so the error occur. i learn from him how he face the problem. My friend varun told me to start the nest.js. so i tell him i will do ticket booking app for booking cinema ticket. He want to learn nest.js with your efforts then only u learn how to survey in the surfboard company. He explain me here no one know eerything. they are pushing themself to do there work mean they have google it and learn that syllabus and then implement in the project. so this is the stage you start learn from own. then it is littlebit easy to survey here. but i think how i can do it with study the webpages to the framework it not possible im think. so first i study the webpages without an interest. and later on my friend santhosh teachs that what thinking or work make you happy he ask me and we share a lot of think. then he realize me one think clearly that. you don't try without an interest it is impossible for u only. i see you that you just leasaning. but you try to push u to learning. and his way of explain my mistake is like it i want to correct me from that mistake. then only i realize the reality is hit me how to learn. u always start thinking from it is impossible means is it impossible for u only. i truely said that santhosh speech only realize me if u want means u have to give the efforts to complete the work.
