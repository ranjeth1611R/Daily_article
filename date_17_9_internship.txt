     Today internship class koushik teach the topic about the grammer, pronunciation, punctuation. he explain this concept details we know something but why should 
follow the rules. His way of explaination is very excellent. I'm always have curiosity while going to the kowshik class because we know something but why is like that
and is purpose of that like we don't think. In kowshik class he teach me we have the awareness to learn that why should we have to learn that his explaination is
crystal clear. in today kowshik class wiithout punctuation, pronunciation how the sentances or words or letters we read it. it slide difficult to read and also 
all the languages have the constraints. we learn that constraints means we learn the language easily. a grammer follows two constraints mainly is one syntax and 
another sematics by using two rules we can able to built a new language. he share a one easier language it an coeser language. he also told that u want to learn 
something means you have to stay focus on that you don't like that, you don't understand that it's not a matter when don't is not a problem because no one know everything
so he said that try to push you for learning something first u face a lot of difficult once u understand and then it is easy for u. so always focussing is important 
thing when u want learn something. today my mentor varun correct my mistake he told me that u understand that in partially. u have understand to the concept details.
it's main mistake u do it repeatedly. so always ask the question why it is in that formet i always u to improves u. always mistake are make the person better. so he 
said it's correct so i want to correct mistake then only know how the framework when i put this comment and also increase my logical thing.
