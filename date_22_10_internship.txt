  today i try to do my project with an step-by-step by using the chatgpt to explain the concept detailed and typeerror is occured for me. so i try to resolve the error
first step i'm read the error and the error is occur from which file i defined the file and then on that file which line is error there will be an red notification on 
particular or approximate show where is error. First i try my own idea to make an console.log to find what the statement or condition are occured on that particular 
line or access method is wrong there will be defined that some of constraints rules are not satisfied means there will be an error is occured. or otherswise using the 
chargpt to copy the error and paste the error in the chatgpt it give some line ou make an alteranation means to resolve the error. i try that but the error cannot solve
so next ask to my mentor varun bro i try my best i can't resolve this error can u help to resolve then he try to make me think and he resolve it
