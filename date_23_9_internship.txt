  Today in morning to afternoon i saw the concept of CRUD operation. The update method only become tough for me. Because for me it's little bit tough to understand 
that how it's working. In update method while I'm saw only one object property are changed and on another method whole object property are changed. so what im done mean
i watch and write the code first one object property it's understand for me. But while saw the whole object update method a little bit confusing is occur for
me and then iam understand the second concept i have an clarity and by using chatgpt comparing the two code to teaches explain me then only i understand that how
