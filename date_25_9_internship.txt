   Today morning koushik class starts easier at 10:30am because of two days his class is leave dueto the reason. Today he teach the topic are token analysis, expression,

syntax, sematics, compilation process, two languages types, compare the english language and programming language, memory, data, information, database, symbols, token,
expression, declaration, what are keyword, primitive and composit. In computer the process of compiliation is happen by this method. first step by using the symbols to
form a token symbol are alphabet, number, special character like that. a combination of symbols are token a token that as a meaning in that language are noun, verb 
like that. a combination of token are valid only. they check the syntax and sematics. syntax means a set of rules, sematics means behind the meaning of the rules.
so using this concept we can able to built a new language also by using thing concept they built communciaton between human and computer.A computer two types of
language typed language abd untyped language. then compare the english language(noun, verb) and programming language(number, string). token analysis a values stores
in memory and the memory have an address. i diffrenciate between data, database, memory. symbol are unicode. unicode means a symbols are used in all language it as
1.1million are there. token are the keyword, variable, operator and punctuation . expression i has produce something[symbols, token, expression, and declaration] by
this we can create an language. today start learning postgres database and i install the postgres database in my laptop by study the instruction in w3schools. and
then i use the sql shell how create a table, insert a data, and retrieve the particular inserted data.
