  today in koushik class he teaches the topic about computation. A compute means something to be solved. A compilation means human understandable language to machine
language. in compilation has happened based on token analysis, syntax and sematics. example for an computatiom is input has taken and is store in memory. the next 
step memory to operation and the operation do the calculation and finally produce the output. then teach the topic about function. in a function inner variable 
and expression are declared. the function will not execute until and unless to call that function. and he discuss the topic about array and map. A map consists of
a key-value pairs and an array consists of list of items and then he discuss the topic about function arguments, parameters, global variable declaration, local
