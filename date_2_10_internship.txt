   For the past three days i'am searching how to connect the CRUD operation to postgres database. I read the documentation, googling and then i saw some of the youtube 
videos but i'am still struggling only. i don't get the conculsion how to connect with database. an error is an incorrect password but actually that my password. It's
really very hurting for me my mind is get depressed. But i can't give up. i am repeated the processing by googling, use the chatgpt how to resolve it, and also i'am
watches the youtube how to define my postgres database password and how to make an CRUD operation by connecting the database. I'am curiously searching all of 
this because my focus is to be only how to solve the program. today koushik class is not available. so i don't learn any new thing my thinking only how to resolved it.
